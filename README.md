# Bamazon
* Bamazon is a command line node application that resembles the inventory tracking of an online retailer.

* Run the command **node bamazonCustomer.js**
  * You will be prompted with a list of all available items for purchase and asked to enter the item id for your desired item and how many you would like.
  * The app checks the MySQL database. If there is not enough of the item in inventory to fill the order, the user is alerted of insufficient quantity. If there is enough inventory, the database is updated with the depleted quantity and the user is told the total cost of their purchase.
